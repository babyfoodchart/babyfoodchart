- Here are tips for creating a baby food chart:

Age-Appropriate Foods: Include soft, mashed, or small, bite-sized foods that your baby can chew and digest easily.
Balanced Nutrition: Plan meals with grains (rice, oats), proteins (lentils, eggs), vegetables, fruits, and dairy for a variety of nutrients.
Meal Timing: Space meals and snacks 2-3 hours apart, with 3 main meals and 2-3 light snacks.
Hydration: Include water, soups, or diluted juices between meals to keep the baby hydrated.
Introduce Variety: Rotate foods to avoid monotony and expose the baby to different flavors and textures.
Avoid Processed Foods: Stick to homemade meals, avoiding salt, sugar, and processed snacks.
Observe and Adjust: Note what your baby enjoys or dislikes and tailor the chart accordingly.
- Example Chart
Morning: Breast milk/formula + mashed banana
Mid-morning: Small pieces of fruit or steamed veggies
Lunch: Soft rice or khichdi with vegetables and ghee
Snack: Yogurt or paneer
Dinner: Porridge (oats, ragi) or dal with roti pieces
Make adjustments based on your baby's appetite and preferences!
